ðŸ”­ I am a proactive person and passionate about programming so in my free time I'm always looking for new projects to do or contribute to, especially if they are open source, that's why I consider my favourite social network to be GitHub.

During my career, I have worked with a wide range of programming languages, including Java, PHP, JavaScript and frameworks/libraries, such as React, Node or Vue.

One of the things I love about programming is that it allows me to transform my ideas into reality and also that thanks to some projects I have been able to meet many people with whom I have cooperated.
